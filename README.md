# myFlix-client2

## Description
-This project is the client side portion of the MyFlix server side API application that is in my Github repository [here](https://github.com/kevintursi/Movie_API). Connecting the server side and client side for these applications utilizes the full MERN stack.\
-This myFlix client side portion of the project utilizes React, Bootstrap, and Redux to build the application.\
-Users are able to to login or sign up initially at the login or signup pages and can access either landing page through the navbar.\
-Once Users are logged in they see a HomeView page that renders all of the movies from the server side Movie API. There is also a search bar in the HomeView where a User can search for movies by Title.\
-Users can open each movie card rendered on HomeView and that will bring them to an individual MovieView page for each individual movie that renders more information (Genre, Director, Description, etc.) and they can also add each specific movie to their list of favorite movies.\
-Users can use the navbar once logged in to reach their individual profile page where they are able to see their user information, edit their user information, delete their account, see their list of favorite movies, and even remove movies from their favorite movies list.\
-Users can logout by pressing the logout button located in the navbar at any landing page once logged in.\
